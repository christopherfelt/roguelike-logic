#Game Todos
- Build Random Generated Path
    - Add specific dead ends
    - Have size adjustments

- Create Play Class
- Develop boundary class




#Next Daily Task:
- Finish adding generateCellRecord to generatePathData
- Test

#Sprint Tasks:
- Create a PathDataGenerator.js
    - Create a Class for Grid Data
    - Create a Class for Cell Data
        - Abstract Out Methods for CellData
- Create a PathDrawer.js
    - Abstract all the draw methods
-Create a Helpers.js
    - Abstract the Grid method out
-Create function to determine connecting paths




Path making logic:
- Can only have to two connections to the wall
    - I will need logic that determines if a square is a boundary
    - These numbers will be generated and saved in the constructor
- Can only draw paths that connect
    - I will need logic that determines if the square around it
    - This will be a function that checks

- Future Refactors:
    - CellData
        - This help generate and manage data for each cell generated
    - GridData
        - Generate and manage data for grid specific data
            - Location of entrance and exit
